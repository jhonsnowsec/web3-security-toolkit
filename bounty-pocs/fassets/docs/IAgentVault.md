This method will work for any token, but for vault collateral and agent pool tokens (which are locked because they may be backing f-assets) there is a check that there was prior announcement by calling `assetManager.announceVaultCollateralWithdrawal(...)`.
NOTE: only the owner of the agent vault may call this method.
